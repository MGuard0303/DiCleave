# DiCleave

DiCleave is a deep neural network model to predict Dicer cleavage site of human precusor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs).


The inputs of DiCleave is a RNA sequence segment and its corresponding pre-miRNA secondary structure embedding. Concretely, the length of RNA sequence segment is 14 nucleotide, with 13 dimensions.
